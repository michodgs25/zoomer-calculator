# Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an amazing calculator with python. 

----------
# UX

## User Stories

### Content Creators

* As a calculator content creator I would like the calculator to be appealing, as my audience engagement goes down otherwise.

# Features

### Main feature

-------

### Issues and bugs
This section looks into what existing issues that are still present in the project& what future iterations could do to resolve these issues:

-------
 
## Defensive design
Certain measure were taken to prevent users from making mistakes or malicious actions.

- Login& registration authentication in place, users must create an account to be able to purchase any product on the platform. 

- General form validation for all forms on the platform with key fields such as first name being required.

- Several get_object_or_404 instances in each application views.

-------
 
## Libraries and Frameworks 

- Github pages: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps - used to deploy my project.

---------

## Languages

  - In this project I used *HTML5*, *CSS*, *JAVASCRIPT*, *PYTHON* languages.
   

## Technologies

These technologies helped create, shape and test my code

* W3.CSS - https://www.w3schools.com/: provided the idea to add an image to the sidenav

* JS hint - https://jshint.com/: Tested my JS code and provided feedback to increase code quality.

* W3S html& css validator - https://validator.w3.org/: Tested both my HTML& CSS code and provided feedback to improve quality.

* Pylint - https://pypi.org/project/pylint/: Used with the IDE terminal typing `pylint app.py` this returns a report of the python code.

* pep8 - http://pep8online.com/: An online python code tester, returns any errors within code inputted.

* mobiReady - https://ready.mobi/: Online app that that test whether the app is mobile ready.

* Google dev tools: found top right corner of the chrome browser, more tool then bottom option. Provided a virtual testing environment(DOM).

## Testing

Summary: *During the development of this project, I experience some minor issues, exhaustively testing the functionality of each part of the platform and managed to solve most of the problems that arose before writing this document.*

*I received help from my family& friends by using the platform features and providing me with valuable feedback such as, ."*

__See testing documentation here: test.md__

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github, using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:

 #### git add -A
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*

## Deployment

#### Requirements 
You will need the following tools& accounts installed on your system and an account with:

An IDE such as Visual Studio, gitpod, Code, or like this project gitpod

I personally used github on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3 and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site to your local machine you will need to go to my repo [here.](https://github.com/michodgs25/Your-song) and see deployment steps in https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository

2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have Python 3.7 installed.

3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.

4. Run the requirements.txt file as appropriate to your IDE to install the relevant required packages dependencies for the project into your virtual environment.

5. Run the app.py file as appropriate to your chosen environment and os.

6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 8000.
